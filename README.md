# Book-recommendation
This project recommends books similar to a given book.

This repo provides an overview of a data analytics project focused on book recommendations. 
The project utilizes concepts from natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and 
information retrieval to recommend books based on their titles, authors, categories, and 
descriptions. 
The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas, sklearn, and nltk. It 
then reads a dataset from a CSV file containing book information and performs initial data 
preprocessing steps. These steps involve selecting relevant columns, converting data types, 
splitting author names, and handling missing values. 
Next, the code performs feature extraction using the CountVectorizer from sklearn. The 'tags' 
column, which combines authors, categories, and descriptions, is transformed into a numerical 
representation suitable for machine learning algorithms. Stemming is applied to further refine 
the textual data by reducing words to their root form. 
Cosine similarity is calculated to measure the similarity between book vectors. This similarity 
matrix is used to build a recommendation system. Given a book title, the code retrieves its 
index, computes the distances to all other books, and generates a list of recommended books 
based on similarity scores. 
Overall, this project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, feature extraction, 
NLP techniques, and machine learning concepts to create an effective book recommendation 
system. The code can be extended and customized to handle larger datasets and incorporate 
additional features for enhanced recommendations.
